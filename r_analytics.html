<h1>R Scripting progress and notes</h1>

<p>Working on the courses delivered by <a href="https://www.datacamp.com">datacamp.com</a>. I've found the interactive tutorials very useful. I am currently working on the 
<u>Introduction to R</u> course.</p>

<h3>Syntax covered:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Build a vector using c() (uni-dimensional array)</li>
  <li>Build a matrix using matrix() (multi-dimensional array)</li>
  <li>Name the elements of a vector name()</li>
  <li>Sum the columns of a matrix using colSum()</li>
  <li>Sum the rows of a matrix using rowSum()</li>
  <li>Calculate the average using mean()</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

  
<h3>Factors</h3>
  <p>Factors can be used as enumerations, and using the terminology of the script, categorical vectors can be broken down 
  into nominal and ordinal sub-categories. Nominal variables are unordered lists: think animal names. Ordinal variables are ordered lists:
  think sequences such as high to low or bottom to top</p>  
  
  <p>The levels() function allows you to assign an alias to a factor e.g. build a vector: my_vector <- c("M","F"); generate a factor from it
   with my_factor <- factor(my_vector); alias the category with levels(my_factor) <- c("Female","Male")</p>
